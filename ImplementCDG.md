# MC CoDe-Graph Improvement Ideas

Suggestion for improvement:
- Scaffolding as an element (e.g., moderator, prompt…)
- Badge element for finishing the course.
- Connecting arrows forward and backward (if student can move back as well; e.g, rewatching an instructional video)
- Locked and unlocked affordances symbols
- Assessment and feedback elements should be kept separately and connected with a line.
- Sequencing should be obvious to the viewer of a design.

### Design 1: MC CoDe-Graph traditional design (based on current model)

Description:
- Badge element included
- Connecting arrows forward and backward included for learning materials (M1 – M3)
- Locked and unlocked affordances symbols visualized by outer layer of building block (e.g., M2-pretest or M3-post-test)
- Assessment and Feedback connected via line
- Sequencing obvious based on flow from left to right

### Design 2: MC CoDe-Graph traditional design + Scaffolding block + ELO block

Description:
- Study Coordination course as a template
- Scaffolding blocks included with example text
- ELO block included (Essay replaced the final test)

### Design 3: MC CoDe-Graph BPMN 2.0 oriented

- Shapes of objects oriented at BPMN 2.0
- Therefore, shape of elements based on the positioning and purpose in the flowchart instead of base shape (e.g., CoDe-Graph building blocks are always the same shape)
- Shape of objects identical besides:
  - Starting point: circle with a thin outer layer
  - Gateway (Branching): rhombus-shaped object (for feedback in this case)
  - End point: circle with thick outer layer
