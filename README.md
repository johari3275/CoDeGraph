# CoDe-Graph

## What is CoDe-Graph?
CoDe-Graph is a graphical modeling language designed to facilitate the co-design of MOOCs. It employs a variety of symbols to represent different elements and activities within an online course. These symbols help in visualizing the course structure, making it easier for designers to collaborate and communicate their ideas.

CoDe-Graph is a graphical modeling language created by the authors of this paper for co-designing MOOCs.
The authors who introduced CoDe-Graph are:
- Allison L. G. Kolling - Saarland University, Germany
- Armin Weinberger - Saarland University, Germany
- Helmut Niegemann - Saarland University, Germany

These authors developed CoDe-Graph to facilitate the co-design of MOOCs, particularly for disadvantaged target groups.
They present case studies of using CoDe-Graph in co-design workshops with educators, designers, technologists etc. to create customized MOOC designs.
The paper discusses the process of co-design with CoDe-Graph and how it helps develop a shared understanding among diverse stakeholders.
So in summary, the authors Allison Kolling, Armin Weinberger, and Helmut Niegemann from Saarland University introduced the CoDe-Graph modeling language for collaborative MOOC design, as described in this paper.
